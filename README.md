### Project Requirements
#### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems, CRM and ERP provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into single user-friendly data model for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both, business stakeholders and analytical teams.

### Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold** layers:

![data architecture](docs/Data Architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from csv files into SQL server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis. 
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

### Repository Structure

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behaviour**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empowers stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
